# Sales Forecasting for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals 

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting future sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project aims to deliver actionable sales forecasts, allowing the finance team to plan and allocate resources efficiently. The solution includes detailed exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, deep learning with LSTM for time series prediction, and serving the predictions through a web API.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build and deploy an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning solution for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals to forecast store sales up to six weeks in advance. Key objectives include:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Develop optimazed predictive model using Machine learning and deep learning Technique.
- Improve decision-making for the finance team, allowing them to optimize resource allocation.
- Serving predictions through a web-based API for real-time access.
- Offer insights into customer behavior based on factors such as promotions, holidays, and competition.
